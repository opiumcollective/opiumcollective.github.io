                Opium is an ever growing art cooperative focused on collaboration around production and distribution of physical, digital, and transmedia art works. Our primary motive is to explore and critique methods of production, expression, and how they interface with contemporary consumer culture. Our key concepts align closely with those proposed by the Neo-Dada movement, with emphasis placed on inviting the viewer to engage in thoughtful criticism through the union of perceived opposites and the idea that the artwork alone is a small piece of a larger picture, and that the viewer stands within the same.
